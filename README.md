# Binary Rainfall Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements machine learning models to predict rainfall with a binary prediction. The goal is to accurately classify whether rainfall will occur (1) or not (0) based on various weather features. This is a simple competition hosted by Kaggle through Walter Reade and Elizabeth Park.
